## Thoughts
I find this article very interesting because it touches on skills that are required to grow and mature within a software engineering career that aren't often mentioned or thought about. In college, computer science students are rarely taught the skills needed to properly collaborate and communicate with their peers, which end up being invaluable in the current field. These skills become more and more important as a software engineer's career progresses, which is seen in the article as the author is in a senior staff position and uses skills like diplomacy, communication, and leadership constantly on a daily basis. I think this article highlights that, along with becoming a better programmer, it is important to focus on building interpersonal skills used in teamwork when learning to be a software engineer.

## Comment from Angela Yu
I found this article interesting as well because of the emphasis on good communication and people skills, which is something often glossed over and software engineers are actually stereotyped as not having.
